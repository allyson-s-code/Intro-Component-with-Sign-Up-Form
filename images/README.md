## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed working on this user interface. I learned a lot about coding forms and displaying errors using JavaScript.

### Continued development

I will be continuing to work on my JavaScript and making it as clean and efficient as possible. I would love to update this code to make it more efficient as I get more comfortable with client-side validation.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp- Form Validation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/form-validation-with-html5-and-javascript/) - This helped me to break down the basics of two approaches to client-side validation.
- [10 Commandments of Good Form Design on the Web](https://mono.company/design-practice/the-10-commandments-of-good-form-design-on-the-web/) - I came across this resource and thought it was a great list of 10 best practices with form design.
